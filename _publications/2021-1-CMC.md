As a key step in the carbon cycle, the decomposition of plant material and woody fibers is of great significance. This process is based on the decomposition of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, etc. by saprophytic fungi. To describe the interaction between various fungi and the effects of environmental and substrate quality on lignocellulosic decomposition, we built a process model with time as its only variable. It is called the relationship model of influence factors. Considering that the decomposition of lignin fibers by saprophytic fungi is affected by biological factors, abiotic factors, and substrate quality, it consists of three basic models: the relationship model of biological factors, the relationship model of abiotic environmental factors, the relationship model of matrix mass.
